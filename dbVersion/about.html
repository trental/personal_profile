			<p>
				I'm a software developer with a background in data analytics and
				insurance. My experience working as an actuary gives me insight to
				operational challenges as well as the development tools needed to solve
				them. It is my goal to continue my work as a professional problem solver
				working from the initial phases of analysis to actionable conclusions
				and implemented solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently looking for full-time work, remote or in the Austin area.
				I am most interested in data and logic-intense back-end projects. I have
				experience coding front-end javascript or React as well.
